  The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is
a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an
intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises
a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the
location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was
tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of
location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the
dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location
accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by
the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the
intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is
avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft
frame structures by the acoustic emission method.

  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of
developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various
statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is
separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from
various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source
separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve
these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability
of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission
sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for
non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission
analysis.

Compton spectra of two exemplary examples, Fornax A and Centaurus A, are
estimated using available radio measurements in the ~10's MHz - 10's GHz range.
For average lobe magnetic fields of >~0.3-1 micro-G, the lobe spectra are
predicted to extend into the soft gamma-rays making them likely detectable with
the GLAST LAT. If detected, their large angular extents (~1 deg and 8 deg) will
make it possible to ``image'' the radio lobes in gamma-rays. Similarly, this
process operates in more distant radio galaxies and the possibility that such
systems will be detected as unresolved gamma-ray sources with GLAST is briefly

bimodality, in which type Ia SNe must explode from both young and old
progenitors, and a ""strong"" bimodality, in which about half of the systems
explode within 10^8 years from formation. The ""weak"" bimodality is
observationally based on the dependence of the rates with the host galaxy SFR,
while the ""strong"" one on the different rates in radio-loud and radio-quiet

estimate the fraction of SNe which are missed by optical and near-IR searches

(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.
  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating
through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)
through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)
through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field
strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,
making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of
relativistic electrons.
  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is
not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the
degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models
and observations.
  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be
explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic
field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging
similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.

both classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective
approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our
approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression.
On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network
classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using
Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable
performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural
networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training
datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and
complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information
retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in
Bioinformatics.

observed by GLAST, with many hundreds detected. Many will be unknown as radio
pulsars, making pulsation detection dependent on radio and/or x-ray
observations or on blind periodicity searches of the gamma-rays. Estimates for
the number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens
to many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this
range, partly due to observations being made in a scanning as opposed to a
pointing mode. This paper briefly reviews how blind pulsar searches will be
conducted using GLAST, what limits these searches, and how the computations and
statistics scale with various parameters.

Ly-alpha, and comes in two flavors: surface and interior. The former is due to
direct, impact excitation of hydrogen atoms crossing the shock, while the
latter is the result of charge transfer reactions between these atoms and
slower, post-shock ions. Interior and surface emission are analogous to the
broad- and narrow-line components observed in Balmer-dominated SNRs. I
summarize a formalism to derive line intensities and ratios in these SNRs, as
well as a study of the transition zone in supernova shocks; I include an
appendix where I derive in detail the ratio of broad to narrow H-alpha
emission. Further study of the reverse shock emission from SNR 1987A will allow
us to predict when it will vanish and further investigate the origins of the
interior emission.

require access to information resources currently rely on users manually
discovering and integrating them in the application. Manual resource discovery
is a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via
keyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidence
from document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the
referring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources --
often called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents in
response to a query. The recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow
users to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide
rich evidence for resource discovery. In this paper, we describe a
probabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking
system del.icio.us. We then use the model to automatically find resources
relevant to a particular information domain. Our experimental results on data
obtained from \emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for
helping automate the resource discovery task.

direct implications on the GLAST detection of extragalactic sources from two
different perspectives: microwave selection and a combined deep X-ray/radio
selection. The first one is a 41 GHz flux-limited sample extracted from the
WMAP 3-yr catalog of microwave point sources. This is a statistically well
defined sample of about 200 blazars and radio galaxies, most of which are
expected to be detected by GLAST. The second one is a new deep survey of
Blazars selected among the radio sources that are spatially coincident with
serendipitous sources detected in deep X-ray images (0.3-10 keV) centered on
the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) discovered by the Swift satellite. This sample is
particularly interesting from a statistical viewpoint since a) it is unbiased
as GRBs explode at random positions in the sky, b) it is very deep in the X-ray
band (\fx \simgt $10^{-15}$ \ergs) with a position accuracy of a few
arc-seconds, c) it will cover a fairly large (20-30 square deg.) area of sky,
d) it includes all blazars with radio flux (1.4 GHz) larger than 10 mJy, making
it approximately two orders of magnitude deeper than the WMAP sample and about
one order of magnitude deeper than the deepest existing complete samples of
radio selected blazars, and e) it can be used to estimate the amount of

of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Observations over the past decade have
ceremoniously unveiled direct evidence of particle acceleration in SNRs to
energies approaching the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum. Nonthermal X-ray
emission from shell-type SNRs reveals multi-TeV electrons, and the dynamical
properties of several SNRs point to efficient acceleration of ions.
Observations of TeV gamma-ray emission have confirmed the presence of energetic
particles in several remnants as well, but there remains considerable debate as
to whether this emission originates with high energy electrons or ions. Equally
uncertain are the exact conditions that lead to efficient particle
acceleration.
  Based on the catalog of EGRET sources, we know that there is a large
population of Galactic gamma-ray sources whose distribution is similar to that
of SNRs. With the increased resolution and sensitivity of GLAST, the gamma-ray
SNRs from this population will be identified. Their detailed emission
structure, along with their spectra, will provide the link between their
environments and their spectra in other wavebands to constrain emission models
and to potentially identify direct evidence of ion acceleration in SNRs. Here I
summarize recent observational and theoretical work in the area of cosmic ray
acceleration by SNRs, and discuss the contributions GLAST will bring to our
understanding of this problem.

detection of cosmic gamma-ray bursts by extending the energy range (20 MeV to >
300 GeV) of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) towards lower energies by 2
BGO-detectors (150 keV to 30 MeV) and 12 NaI(Tl) detectors (10 keV to 1 MeV).
The physical detector response of the GBM instrument for GRBs is determined
with the help of Monte Carlo simulations, which are supported and verified by
on-ground calibration measurements, performed extensively with the individual
detectors at the MPE in 2005. All flight and spare detectors were irradiated
with calibrated radioactive sources in the laboratory (from 14 keV to 4.43
MeV). The energy/channel-relations, the dependences of energy resolution and
effective areas on the energy and the angular responses were measured. Due to
the low number of emission lines of radioactive sources below 100 keV,
calibration measurements in the energy range from 10 keV to 60 keV were
performed with the X-ray radiometry working group of the

BGO-detectors (150 keV to 30 MeV) and 12 NaI(Tl) detectors (10 keV to 1 MeV).
The physical detector response of the GBM instrument for GRBs is determined

on-ground calibration measurements, performed extensively with the individual

with calibrated radioactive sources in the laboratory (from 14 keV to 4.43
MeV). The energy/channel-relations, the dependences of energy resolution and
effective areas on the energy and the angular responses were measured. Due to
the low number of emission lines of radioactive sources below 100 keV,
calibration measurements in the energy range from 10 keV to 60 keV were
performed with the X-ray radiometry working group of the

determine the ISIDs with much improved accuracy. Should any difference exist

difficult to understand. The Wignerfunctions of eigenstates converge weakly to
invariant measures of the classical system, the so called quantum limits, and
one would like to understand which invariant measures can occur that way,

a class of maps on the torus for whose quantisations we can understand the set
of quantum limits in great detail. In particular we can construct examples of
ergodic maps which have singular ergodic measures as quantum limits, and
examples of non-ergodic maps where arbitrary convex combinations of absolutely
continuous ergodic measures can occur as quantum limits. The maps we quantise

a chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase
and surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number
of diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon
dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation
is started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no
surface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat
or rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O
and CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the
conditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a
significant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,
the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in
turn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface
chemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal
desorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted
molecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows
determination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The

vigorously over the organisation of the theory of bilinear forms. That theory
promised a ""general"" and ""homogeneous"" treatment of numerous questions arising
in various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems,
stated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered
equivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two
theorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us
to explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the
manipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to
linear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods
for the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices --
Jordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation -- reflect
identities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these
practices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also --
in light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau-
chy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of
generality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra
and arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices,
this study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra
without focusing on issues related to the origins of theories or structures.

around the equation of secular inequalities (1766- 1874). In 1874, a strong
controversy on the theory of bilinear and quadratic forms opposed Camille
Jordan and Leopold Kronecker. The arithmetical ideal of Kronecker faced
Jordan's claim for the simplicity of his algebraic canonical form. As the
controversy combined mathematical and historical arguments, it gave rise to the
writing of a history of the methods used by Lagrange, Laplace and Weierstrass

unable to optimize them directly and focus on pairwise comparisons instead. We
present a new approach which allows direct optimization of the relevant loss
functions. This is achieved via structured estimation in Hilbert spaces. It is
most related to Max-Margin-Markov networks optimization of multivariate
performance measures. Key to our approach is that during training the ranking
problem can be viewed as a linear assignment problem, which can be solved by
the Hungarian Marriage algorithm. At test time, a sort operation is sufficient,
as our algorithm assigns a relevance score to every (document, query) pair.
Experiments show that the our algorithm is fast and that it works very well.

bluffing is even open for debate, adding further complication to the process of
creating intelligent virtual players that can bluff, and hence play,
realistically. Through the use of intelligent, learning agents, and carefully
designed agent outlooks, an agent can in fact learn to predict its opponents
reactions based not only on its own cards, but on the actions of those around
it. With this wider scope of understanding, an agent can in learn to bluff its
opponents, with the action representing not an illogical action, as bluffing is
often viewed, but rather as an act of maximising returns through an effective
statistical optimisation. By using a tee dee lambda learning algorithm to
continuously adapt neural network agent intelligence, agents have been shown to
be able to learn to bluff without outside prompting, and even to learn to call
each others bluffs in free, competitive play.

concrete problem, the idea is, first working in the abstract problem and
finding its optimal solutions, then using them to solve the concrete problem.
  In particular, we show that a mapping preserves optimal solutions if and only
if it is an order-reflecting semiring homomorphism. Moreover, for a semiring
homomorphism $\alpha$ and a problem $P$ over $S$, if $t$ is optimal in
$\alpha(P)$, then there is an optimal solution $\bar{t}$ of $P$ such that
$\bar{t}$ has the same value as $t$ in $\alpha(P)$.

  General Graphs","6 pages, 2 figures","","","","cs.IT cs.AI cs.LG cs.NI math.IT","","  Max-product belief propagation is a local, iterative algorithm to find the
mode/MAP estimate of a probability distribution. While it has been successfully
employed in a wide variety of applications, there are relatively few
theoretical guarantees of convergence and correctness for general loopy graphs
that may have many short cycles. Of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary
and sufficient'' characterizations.
  In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the
maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done
by first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the
optimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be
posed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This
relaxation is not always tight. In this paper we show that \begin{enumerate}
\item If the LP relaxation is tight, then max-product always converges, and
that too to the correct answer. \item If the LP relaxation is loose, then
max-product does not converge. \end{enumerate} This provides an exact,
data-dependent characterization of max-product performance, and a precise
connection to LP relaxation, which is a well-studied optimization technique.
Also, since LP relaxation is known to be tight for bipartite graphs, our
results generalize other recent results on using max-product to find weighted
matchings in bipartite graphs.

and regression problems. An ensemble of Fuzzy-ARTMAPs is used for
classification whereas an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons is used for the
regression problem. Results obtained using this ensemble-based technique are
compared to those obtained using a combination of auto-associative neural

a balanced interval, e.g., a certain combination of phone numbers are called
almost every Friday or a group of products are sold a lot on Tuesday and
Thursday.
  In previous work we proposed a new measure of support (the number of
occurrences of a pattern in a dataset), where we count the number of times a
pattern occurs (nearly) in the middle between two other occurrences. If the
number of non-occurrences between two occurrences of a pattern stays almost the
same then we call the pattern balanced.
  It was noticed that some very frequent patterns obviously also occur with a
balanced interval, meaning in every transaction. However more interesting
patterns might occur, e.g., every three transactions. Here we discuss a
solution using standard deviation and average. Furthermore we propose a simpler
approach for pruning patterns with a balanced interval, making estimating the
pruning threshold more intuitive.

classical potential flow approach. The Helmholtz-Leray decomposition is applied
to the linearized 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations are
treated using Fourier--Laplace transforms. We show how to express the vortical
component of the velocity only in terms of the potential and free-surface
elevation. A new predominant nonlocal viscous term is derived in the bottom
kinematic boundary condition. The resulting formulation is simple and does not
involve any correction procedure as in previous viscous potential flow theories

where each vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector. The absence
of an edge between any pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to full
conditional independence between these two variables given all the other
variables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edge
corresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverse
of the covariance matrix. It is well known that this concentration graph
represents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the
associated random vector. These conditional independencies correspond to the
""separations"" or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume that
there are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than
those represented by the graph. This property is called the perfect
Markovianity of the probability distribution with respect to the associated
concentration graph. We prove in this paper that this particular concentration
graph, the one associated with a perfect Markov distribution, can be determined
by only conditioning on a limited number of variables. We demonstrate that this
number is equal to the maximum size of the minimal separators in the
concentration graph.

computing devices, there has been an ongoing debate whether all conscious
activities are computational processes. In this paper, the answer to this
question is shown to be no. A certain phenomenon of consciousness is
demonstrated to be fully represented as a computational process using a quantum
computer. Based on the computability criterion discussed with Turing machines,
the model constructed is shown to necessarily involve a non-computable element.
The concept that this is solely a quantum effect and does not work for a
classical case is also discussed.

  Data Analysis","10 pages, 1 figure, Update Bibliography","","","","cs.NE cs.AI q-bio.QM","","  In this paper, we present a method to optimise rough set partition sizes, to
which rule extraction is performed on HIV data. The genetic algorithm
optimisation technique is used to determine the partition sizes of a rough set
in order to maximise the rough sets prediction accuracy. The proposed method is
tested on a set of demographic properties of individuals obtained from the
South African antenatal survey. Six demographic variables were used in the
analysis, these variables are; race, age of mother, education, gravidity,
parity, and age of father, with the outcome or decision being either HIV
positive or negative. Rough set theory is chosen based on the fact that it is
easy to interpret the extracted rules. The prediction accuracy of equal width
bin partitioning is 57.7% while the accuracy achieved after optimising the
partitions is 72.8%. Several other methods have been used to analyse the HIV
data and their results are stated and compared to that of rough set theory
(RST).

instrumentation, in computer imaging systems and in computer vision are
presented. Then a common general forward modeling for them is given and the
corresponding inversion problem is presented. Then, after showing the
inadequacy of the classical analytical and least square methods for these ill
posed inverse problems, a Bayesian estimation framework is presented which can
handle, in a coherent way, all these problems. One of the main steps, in
Bayesian inversion framework is the prior modeling of the unknowns. For this
reason, a great number of such models and in particular the compound hidden
Markov models are presented. Then, the main computational tools of the Bayesian
estimation are briefly presented. Finally, some particular cases are studied in
detail and new results are presented.

XBS survey (which is 86% optically identified) showing an optical spectrum
dominated by the light from the host galaxy with no evidence (or little
evidence) for the presence of an AGN. METHODS: We use the X-ray spectral
analysis to assess the presence of an AGN in these sources and to characterize
its properties. RESULTS: We detect AGN activity in 33 out of 35 sources. The
remaining 2 sources are the ones with the lowest X-ray luminosity in the sample
(L[2-10keV]<10^41 erg s^-1) and their X-ray emission could be produced within
the host galaxy. We find that the ``recognition problem'' for AGN is very
critical in the low-luminosity regime (at least 60% of the AGN with
L[2-10keV]<10^43 erg s^-1 are elusive) becoming negligible for high X-ray
luminosities (~1.5% of elusive AGN with L[2-10keV]>10^44 erg s^-1). This
problem affects mostly absorbed AGN (~40% of type~2 AGN in the survey are
elusive) but also a significant fraction of unabsorbed AGN (8%). CONCLUSIONS:
We find that the simplest explanations of why these 33 (or most of them) AGNs
are elusive are two: at low X-ray luminosities (<10^43 erg s^-1) the most
important reason is the intrinsically low AGN/galaxy contrast (optical
dilution) while at high luminosities (>10^44 erg s^-1) it is due to the optical
absorption (in the Compton-thin regime, i.e. NH<10^24 cm^-2). Alternative
hypotheses, like the presence of Compton-thick sources, BL Lac objects or
``non-standard'' AGN (e.g. with alpha_OX<1 or with weak/absorbed Narrow Line

SN1987A and some implications of similar ring nebulae around Galactic B
supergiants. There are notable obstacles for the formation of SN1987A's bipolar
nebula through interacting winds in a transition from a red supergiant to a
blue supergiant. Instead, several clues hint that the nebula may have been
ejected in an LBV-like event. In addition to the previously known example of
Sher25, there are two newly-discovered Galactic analogs of SN1987A's ringed
nebula. Of these three Galactic analogs around blue supergiants, two (Sher25
and SBW1) have chemical abundances indicating that they have not been through a
red supergiant phase, and the remaining ringed bipolar nebula surrounds a
luminous blue variable (HD168625). Although SK-69 202's initial mass of 20 Msun
is lower than those atributed to most LBVs, it is not far off, and the
low-luminosity end of the LBV phenomenon is not well defined. Furthermore,
HD168625's luminosity indicates an initial mass of only 25 Msun, that of SBW1
is consistent with 20 Msun, and there is a B[e] star in the SMC with an initial
mass of 20 Msun that experienced an LBV outburst in the 1990s. These
similarities may be giving us important clues about Sk-69 202's pre-SN
evolution and the formation mechanism of its nebula.

resolving the near and far sides of the ring. We compare these line profiles to
similar echelle spectra of H$\alpha$ and [N II] 6583 obtained at the Magellan

II], but the He I profiles also have different shapes -- they have enhanced
emission at high speeds, with extra blueshifted emission on the north side of
the ring, and extra redshifted emission on the south side. To explain this, we
invoke a simple geometric picture where the extra He I emission traces hotter
gas from faster shocks that strike the apex of the hotspots directly, while the
H-alpha preferentially traces cooler lower-ionization gas from slower
transverse shocks that penetrate into the sides of the ring.

emergence of soft X-rays from the interaction of the explosion shock wave with
the ambient medium. This shock wave is now interacting strongly with the inner
ring and might have passed already the highest density regions. The emission
can be described by thermal models with two temperatures, with perhaps some but
little change over time. Relative to the elemental abundances prevailing in the
LMC the inner ring shows an overabundance of Si and S compared to the lighter
elements and Fe, which suggests that the ring consists of highly processed
matter dredged up in a binary merger event well before the explosion. The X-ray

ejecta (PE) to produce the ""Mystery Spot"" (MS). The SN flash takes an extra 8 d
to hit the MS, and this was confirmed at 2e39 ergs/s in the optical at day 8. A
ramp in luminosity starting near day 10 indicates particles from the BJ hitting
the PE, with the fastest particles traveling at 0.8 c, and an upper limit for
the optical luminosity of the MS of 5e40 ergs/s at day 20. The details of SN
1987A strongly suggest that it resulted from a merger of 2 stellar cores of a
common envelope (CE) binary, i.e. a ""double-degenerate"" (DD)-initiated SN, and
is thus the Rosetta Stone for 99% of MSPs in the non-core-collapsed globular
clusters, GRBs, and SNe, including all recent nearby SNe except SN 1986J and
the more distant SN 2006gy. Without having to blast through the CE of Sk -69
202, it is likely that the BJ would have caused a full, long-soft gamma-ray
burst (lGRB) upon hitting the PE, thus DD can produce lGRBs. The typical 0.5
deg collimation of a GRB, over the 22 lt-d from SN 1987A to its PE, produces
~100 s of delay, MATCHING the observed delay of the non-prompt parts of lGRBs.
Because DD must be the dominant SN mechanism in elliptical galaxies, where only
short, hard GRBs (sGRBs) have been observed, DD without CE or PE must also make
sGRBs, thus the initial photon spectrum of 99% of ALL GRBs is KNOWN, & neutron
star (NS)-NS mergers may not make GRBs as we know them. Observations of Ia's
strongly suggest that these are also DD, implying another systematic effect in
Ia Cosmology, as Ia's will appear to be Ic's when viewed from their DD merger
poles, given sufficient matter above that lost to core- collapse (otherwise it
would just beg the question of what ELSE they could possibly be). There is no
need to invent exotica, such as collapsars or hypernovae, to account for GRBs.

spirit of Mackey, Gudder, Ballentine) to represent and to generalize some
results of quantum logic about possible macroscopic quantum-like (QL)
behaviour. The crucial point is that our model provides QL-representation of
macroscopic configurations in terms of complex probability amplitudes -- wave
functions of such configurations. Thus, instead of the language of propositions
which is common in quatum logic, we use the language of wave functions which is
common in the conventional presentation of QM. We propose a quantum-like
representation algorithm, QLRA, which maps probabilistic data of any origin in
complex (or even hyperbolic) Hilbert space. On the one hand, this paper
clarifyes some questions in foundations of QM, since some rather mystical
quantum features are illustrated on the basis of behavior of macroscopic
systems. On the other hand, the approach developed in this paper may be used
e.g. in biology, sociology, or psychology. Our example of QL-representation of
hidden macroscopic configurations can find natural applications in those

excellently located to perform microlens parallax observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC) and the Galactic bulge. These yield the so-called
``projected velocity'' of the lens, which can distinguish statistically among
different populations. A few such measurements toward the LMC/SMC would reveal
the nature of the lenses being detected in this direction (dark halo objects,
or ordinary LMC/SMC stars). Cool Spitzer has already made one such measurement
of a (rare) bright red-clump source, but warm (presumably less oversubscribed)
Spitzer could devote the extra time required to obtain microlens parallaxes for
the more common, but fainter, turnoff sources. Warm Spitzer could observe bulge
microlenses for 38 days per year, which would permit up to 24 microlens
parallaxes per year. This would yield interesting information on the disk mass
function, particularly old brown dwarfs, which at present are inaccessible by
other techniques. Target-of-Opportunity (TOO) observations should be divided
into RTOO/DTOO, i.e., ``regular'' and ``disruptive'' TOOs, as pioneered by the
Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). LMC/SMC parallax measurements would be
DTOO, but bulge measurements would be RTOO, i.e., they could be scheduled in
advance, without knowing exactly which star was to be observed.

contexts such as cluster validation and cluster ensemble techniques. The
classic approach is to minimize the euclidean distance between two cluster
solutions which induces inappropriate stability in certain settings. Therefore,
we present the truematch algorithm that introduces two improvements best
explained in the crisp case. First, instead of maximizing the trace of the
cluster crosstable, we propose to maximize a chi-square transformation of this
crosstable. Thus, the trace will not be dominated by the cells with the largest
counts but by the cells with the most non-random observations, taking into
account the marginals. Second, we suggest a probabilistic component in order to
break ties and to make the matching algorithm truly random on random data. The
truematch algorithm is designed as a building block of the truecluster
framework and scales in polynomial time. First simulation results confirm that
the truematch algorithm gives more consistent truecluster results for unequal
cluster sizes. Free R software is available.

turbulence production by isotropic cosmic-ray ions streaming upstream of
supernova remnant shocks. The studies aim at testing the MHD predictions by
Bell (2004, 2005) of a strong amplification of short-wavelength nonresonant
wave modes and at studying the subsequent evolution of the magnetic turbulence
and its backreaction on cosmic ray trajectories. The detailed knowledge of the
upstream turbulence properties is crucial to ascertain all aspects of the shock
acceleration process - the transport properties of cosmic rays, the shock
structure, thermal particle injection and heating processes. An amplification
of magnetic field would also facilitate the acceleration of particles beyond
the ""knee"" in the cosmic-ray spectrum. Our kinetic approach is particularly
suited to address the backreaction on the cosmic rays, and it allows us to test
Bell's prediction of the eventual formation of extended filamentary structure
in the cosmic-ray distribution and also to arrive at a reliable estimate of the
total saturation magnetic-field level. The parameters chosen for the
simulations are favorable for the rapid excitation of purely growing modes. We
confirm the generation of the turbulent magnetic field due to the drift of
cosmic-ray ions in the upstream plasma, but show that the growth rate of the
field perturbations is much slower than estimated using the MHD approach and
the amplitude of the turbulence saturates at about dB/B~1. The magnetic field
also remains below equipartition with the upstream plasma.

arise in many settings, such as protein interaction and gene regulatory
networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing
such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple
exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold.
In this paper, we describe a latent variable model of such data called the
mixed membership stochastic blockmodel. This model extends blockmodels for
relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational

develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate

EXIST could measure variability and spectra of Blazars in the hard X-ray

inverse Compton component, thereby uniquely constraining intrinsic source
spectra and allowing measured high energy spectral breaks to measure the cosmic

indeed the validity of SSC models) and the origin of the >100 MeV gamma-ray

among characters in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG). The MMOG
individuals constitute a synthetic population, and the game can be seen as a
form of interactive executable model for studying disease spread, albeit of a
very special kind. To a game developer maintaining an MMOG, recognizing,
monitoring, and ultimately controlling a virtual plague is important,
regardless of how it was initiated. The prospect of using tools, methods and
theory from the field of epidemiology to do this seems natural and appealing.
We will address the feasibility of such a prospect, first by considering some
basic measures used in epidemiology, then by pointing out the differences
between real world epidemics and virtual plagues. We also suggest directions
for MMOG developer control through epidemiological modeling. Our aim is
understanding the properties of virtual plagues, rather than trying to
eliminate them or mitigate their effects, as would be in the case of real
infectious disease.

cognitive sciences with the inception of the Semantic Web initiative. The
Semantic Web effort has brought forth an array of technologies that support the
encoding, storage, and querying of the semantic network data structure at the
world stage. Currently, the popular conception of the Semantic Web is that of a
data modeling medium where real and conceptual entities are related in
semantically meaningful ways. However, new models have emerged that explicitly
encode procedural information within the semantic network substrate. With these
new technologies, the Semantic Web has evolved from a data modeling medium to a
computational medium. This article provides a classification of existing
computational modeling efforts and the requirements of supporting technologies
that will aid in the further growth of this burgeoning domain.

NeuroDyne (et al.) focused on Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) on a Lam
9600 aluminum plasma etch reactor, used in the process of semiconductor
fabrication. Fault classification was accomplished by implementing a series of
virtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors,
Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints
and wafer state characteristics. Fault detection and classification were
performed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected
values. Models utilized include linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network
PLS. Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a
capability for cross-checking that the machine is maintaining the desired
setpoints. Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction and
Remaining Oxide were estimated on-line using these same process sensors (Lam,
OES, RFM). Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics in a production
setting (where typically this information may be only sparsely available, if at
all, after batch processing runs with numerous wafers have been completed)
would provide important information to the operator that the process is or is
not producing wafers within acceptable bounds of product quality. Production
yield is increased, and correspondingly per unit cost is reduced, by providing
the operator with the opportunity to adjust the process or machine before
etching more wafers.
