# Built-in functions

# In addition to us being able to create custom functions, R also provides many built-in functions (recall mean(), median()). These functions are already defined and can be used to simplify tasks - (lm()).

# Exercise
# Create a numeric vector, give it a name you want. Use some in-built functions on the vector.

muideen <- c(1:100)

mean(muideen)
