# Control Structure in R

Now that we have covered, data type and data structure, we can start our programming in R, starting with the control structure.

In programming, the control structures allow us to control the flow of execution of a program. This enables us to specify statements to be executed, and in what order they are to be executed. This often depends on the value of a variable or the outcome of a condition.

## Types of Control Structures in R

We have 3 main types of control structures in R:

Sequence: Statements are executed in the order in which they appear in the code.

Selection: Statements are executed only if a certain condition is met.

Loop: Statements are executed repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
