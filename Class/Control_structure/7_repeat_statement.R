# Repeat Statement

# The repeat loop is useful when we donâ€™t know the required number of iterations. It initially initiates an infinite loop. We must use the break statement to avoid an infinite loop

# The repeat loop is similar to the while loop, but the repeat loop will continue to execute the code until the condition is met.

# repeat {
# code to be executed repeatedly

# check condition

# if (condition) {
  #break
#  }
# }

x <- 21
i <- 11
repeat{
  if (i == x) {
    print("i have found it")
    
    break
    
  }
  
  print("I have not found it")
  
  i <- i+1
}
