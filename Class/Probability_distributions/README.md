# Probability Distributions

Probability is the study of chance. It is a way of measuring how likely it is that an event will occur. Probability is used in many different areas (statistics, decision-making, gambling, amongst others).

In session 2, we looked at measures of:

Central tendency

Variability, and

Distribution of the data.

## Random variables

A common term we will often mention when discussing probability is random variables

A random variable is a numerical outcome of an experiment.

Randomn variables can be discrete or continuous.

Discrete random variable can take on only a countable number of possibilities.

P(X=k)
Continuous random variable can take any value on the real line.

P(X∈S)

### Examples of random variables

The outcome of flipping a coin

The outcome from rolling a die

The blood level of an individual randomly drawn from a population

## The sum of the probabilities:

Sum of all possible outcomes must be equal to 1. - If you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Therefore, the sum of the probabilities of all six outcomes must be equal to 1.

## Probability of two events occurring together:

Probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of their probabilities. - If you flip a coin and roll a die, there are two possible outcomes for the coin flip (head or tail) and six possible outcomes for the die roll (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).

## The probability of two events occurring separately:

The probability of two events occurring separately is equal to the sum of their probabilities. - If you flip a coin and roll a die, there are two possible outcomes for the coin flip (head or tail) and six possible outcomes for the die roll (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).


## Probability Distribution

Probability distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of obtaining various values for a random variable. Depending on whether the random variable can take specific values (discrete) or a range of values (continuous).

## Discrete Probability Distributions:

This describes random variables that can only take on a finite number of values. For example, the number of heads that come up when you flip a coin is a discrete random variable.

## Continuous Probability Distributions:

This describes random variables that can take on an infinite number of values. For example, the height of a person is a continuous random variable.

## Describing probability distributions

We can describe probability distributions by their unique properties.

There are several different types of probability distributions. Some of the most common probability distributions include:

Bernoulli,

Binomial,

Poisson distributions and

Normal

They all have their own unique characteristics often used to describe different types of data.

## Bernoulli distribution :
This distribution is used to describe a random variable that can take on two values, such as heads or tails.

The Bernoulli distribution arises as the result of a binary outcome

Bernoulli random variables take (only) the values 1 and 0 with probabilities of (say) p
 and 1−p
  respectively

## Bernoulli & Binomial

We talk of Bernoulli Distribution when we are looking at the success or failure of a single Bernoulli trial while the Binomial Distribution represents the number of successes and failures in n independent Bernoulli trials for some given value of n.

## Poisson distribution:

This distribution is used to describe a random variable that measures the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval of time or space. For example, the number of SAIL Data Fellowship participants that will visit the materials website in a day.

Some uses for the Poisson distribution
Modeling event/time data

Modeling survival data

Approximating binomials when n
 is large and p
  is small
